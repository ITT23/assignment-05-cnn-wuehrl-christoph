## WÃ¼hrl (13.5/15P)

### 1 Exploring Hyperparameters (4/5P)

 * hyperparameter values make sense
   * yes (1P)
 * networks were trained correctly
   * yes (1P)
 * there are results
   * yes (1P)
 * report and visualization
   * inference time missing - inference time is the time needed for a prediction, not training time (-0.5P)
   * some duplicate code could be removed by using functions or a constant (-0.5P)
   * rest looks fine (1P)

### 2 Dataset (5/5P)

 * sufficient images captured
   * yes (1P)
 * sufficient images annotated
   * yes (2P)
 * annotations compatible with HaGRID dataset
   * yes (1P)
 * confusion matrix
   * yes (1P)

### 3 Media Controls (4.5/5P)

 * three hand poses are tracked and distinguished reliably
   * yes (2P)
 * three media control features implemented
   * yes (1P)
 * mapping works and makes sense
   * yes (1P)
 * low latency
   * actual detection seems to be fast but the 700 ms delay make the application pretty sluggish (0.5P)
